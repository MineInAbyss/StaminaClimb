A Spigot plugin that allows for a basic stamina and climbing system.

## Stamina
* Turns on in Survival or Adventure mode. Toggle with /climb
* Stamina shows as a boss bar
* Stamina decreases while climbing or after taking fall damage, and regenerates naturally
* Once stamina reaches 0, the player gets a debuff and cannot climb until stamina fully recovers

## Climbing
* Right click on a wall to start climbing
* Move around normally as if in fly mode
* Left click to dash. It is possible to dash once again in mid air.
* Double tap jump to let go
